## Getting Started
Firstly, run `yarn` in the terminal to make sure all packages are installed. **_yarn_** is 
currently performing better than **_npm_** and the tools seem to be happier dealing with
dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the calculator app in the development mode.\
Browser should launch, or open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
